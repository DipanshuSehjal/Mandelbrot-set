The [Mandelbrot set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set) is one of the most complex and beautiful images arising from mathematics. It is defined to be the set of [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number) for which the function f<sub>c</sub>(z) = z<sup>2</sup> + c does not diverge when iterated from z=0. For a clear explanation of what that means, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGMRB4O922I) on YouTube featuring Dr. Holly Krieger from MIT.
